2D hand representation allows 2D convolution but also introduces an artificial order to the suits (i.e spadesuit > heartsuit > diamondsuit > clubsuit). To overcome this issue, we can employ graph representation of player's hand (see below). 4 cards of a rank can be represented using a group of 4 fully-connected nodes (i.e. a group). Two group can only connect via nodes that have the same suit. Thus, there are six connections within a group and there are four connections between two consecutive group. Each hand is represented with 52 nodes and each nodes has 2 features: its rank (from 1 to 13) and whether the card is in the hand (1) or not (0). A connection is only activated (1) if its nodes are all activated. Note that many non-trivial decisions need to be made while designing this representation. For example, we need to treat the edge between cards in the same rank differently than edges of card between ranks; otherwise, a triangle will be treated the same as a run.

Figure 1: [QH, 3H, QS, 6D, JC, 5S, AC, 7D, 6H, 3C] graph representation of hand. Cards that are presented and not presented in the hand are in red and black, respectively. Otherwise, the node color is black. Activated and inactivated connection is in blue and black, respectively.
