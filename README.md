# Gin Rummy

## Early development component (Summer 2020)
Gin Rummy software for the Gin Rummy EAAI Undergraduate Research Challenge. Implementation of the Dual Inception player from Truong 2021 with three main components: 
* Convolution neural network for pattern recognition on maxtrix hand representations. 
* Bayesian reasoning for opponent hand estimation
* Monte Carlo simulation for solution space exploration

To test the player, run GinRummy.java concurrently with Service.py. 

## Summer 2021 development ideas:
- [ ] Representation of game state
  - [x] Learning on matrix
  - [ ] Learning on graph
  - [ ] Explainable AI 

- [ ] Opponent han estimation 
  - [ ] Bayesian learning

- [ ] Hand evaluation 
  - [ ]  Counter factual regret minimization: http://modelai.gettysburg.edu/2013/cfr/cfr.pdf
  - [ ]  Reinforcement learning
